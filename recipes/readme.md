| 1 cup peeled and diced | Yukon gold potatoes | 
| 1 cup peeled and diced | sweet potatoes | 
| 1 cup dried | red lentils | 
| 6 cups | chicken stock | 
| 3/4 teaspoons | freshly ground black pepper | 
| 3/4 cup diced | zucchini | 
| 3/4 cup diced | yellow squash | 
| 1 cup tightly packed | baby spinach | 
| 1 (14-ounce) can | unsweetened coconut milk |

| 1 tablespoon | apple cider vinegar (OR lemon) | 
| 3 cups steamed | white basmati rice |

#### Directions
* Set a 4 or 5-quart saucepan over medium heat and add the ghee.
* Season the chicken with the garam masala and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt.
* Once the ghee is hot, add the chicken and cook, turning often, until golden brown and fragrant, 6 hto 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside to cool.
* While the chicken is cooling, add the onions, carrots and celery to the hot pan and saute until lightly caramelized, about 4 to 5 minutes.
* Add the garlic, ginger and apples to the pan and saute until the apples are caramelized, about 7 to 8 minutes.
* Add the potatoes, sweet potatoes, and lentils to the pan, along with 4 cups of the chicken stock.
* Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil.
* Reduce to a simmer and cook the soup until the potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes.
* Add the reserved chicken, the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, the pepper, remaining 2 cups of chicken stock, zucchini, squash, spinach, coconut milk, and tomatoes.
* Continue to cook the soup at a simmer until the lentils and chicken are both tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
* Remove from the heat and stir in the cider vinegar lemon.
* Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

#### Service
* place 1/4 cup of the rice in a warmed bowl, and pour 8 ounces of the soup over the rice,
* garnish with a tablespoon of the cashews,
* 2 teaspoons of the cilantro
