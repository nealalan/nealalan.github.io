* Continue to cook the soup at a simmer until the lentils and chicken are both tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
* Remove from the heat and stir in the cider vinegar lemon.
* Taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary.

#### Service

#### Directions
1. In a large pot, cook the bacon strips until crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Discard all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat or, if there's less than 2 tablespoons, add enough olive oil to make up the amount.

3. Add the lentils, salt, pepper, rosemary, bay leaf and water to the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add the cauliflower florets and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower and lentils are tender, about 15 minutes longer. Remove the bay leaf.
